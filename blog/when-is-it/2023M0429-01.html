            <p>Few weeks ago, while i was taking a break after doing some of my assignments, i saw a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsojLuJpe_0">video by Johnny Harris on YouTube</a> about how he made his video (even though i rarely watch him, but still it's interesting to watch). He said that a plugin called 'GEOLayers' helped him a lot in visualizing maps in the majority of his video and made the video production much faster than using a vector map imported from Illustrator. As a video editor surely enough, i wanna try that plugin too.</p>
            
            <p>As usual, i fired up my computer and searched at Google on find out if 'GEOLayers' is also available on Vegas Pro. As its turns out, Vegas Pro didn't have any cool and great plugins like After Effects did. Vegas Pro isn't a program that has the same features (or is even comparable) to After Effects. Vegas Pro is usually used for video and audio editing with little (and simple) animation. After Effects on the other hand, is usually used to create motion graphics and you know, effects for your video/footage</p>
            
            <p>So that's why i started to learn how to use After Effects few weeks ago. Not only because i want to try 'GEOLayers', but also i wanna try to get out from my comfort zone (i've been using Vegas Pro since 2016) and discover the new world of motion graphics.</p>

              <p>I'll update my progress on this thing in few weeks (or maybe months if i forget).</p> 
              
              <p>See ya.</p>
